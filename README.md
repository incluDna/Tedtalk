üôåüèª I got the project about the TEDxGlobal issue. First of all, I found an interesting topic that led me to choose "Cybersecurity." I believe this topic is suitable for elaboration and is crucial for making people aware of the importance of privacy and security in the network. In today's fast-paced technological world, even hackers and scammers are constantly developing their skills.
